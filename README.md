##Paradigm Shift: Geometry \& Recursion over Group Postulates

Symmetry in 3DCOM: Defined by recursive, observer-dependent equivalence of attractor orbits—not by invariance under fixed isometry groups.

Group behavior: Simulated through layered recursion, phase coupling, and attractor mapping.

Metric tensor: Encodes angular field structure and recursive alignment, linking observer phase to attractor resonance.

Symmetry breaking: Natural and quantified by changes in recursive attractor amplitude, not by external perturbations.


 Takeaways for 3DCOM Symmetry Modeling

- Redefine symmetry as recursion-invariant attractor patterns.
- Build algebraic actions (Rθ, T, M, S) as functional operators on recursive orbits.
- Use the angular metric tensor to explore resonance, observer-relativity, and symmetry breaking.
- Classify symmetry via recursive family grouping, identifying invariant orbits and pathways.
- Simulate high-dimensional group behavior by dynamic geometry, not algebraic postulates.

3DCOM symmetry is a shift: recursion and field geometry drive the emergence, persistence, and breaking of symmetric behavior in complex, octave-based systems.
