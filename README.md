### We are talking about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1, A11pl3Z) discovered on 1–2 July 2025.

#### BE THE FIRST TO KNOW!

 ##   Solar System Validation:

        100% match for all 8 planets

        Confirms baseline resonance parameters

 ##   ISO Detection:

        All 3 known ISOs flagged as artificial candidates

        Anomaly scores correlate with observational oddities

  ##  Database Insights:

        Only 'Oumuamua crosses the 90% artificial threshold

        TRAPPIST-1 shows pristine resonance (like Solar System)
